TO DO 20/05/2020:

1) Make scatterplot with x values being carers' mental demand (from NASA_TLX)
    for each session and y the donning time for that particular session

    
2) make two plots in the same window so can be saved as one image. On the left
    patient_and_ot_donning_all_s_1_5_10_14_averaged (without log regression on plot or in legend) and on the
    right the scatter plot described above. The plots should be the same size and same font size for axes,
     titles etc. Ideally, the width of the entire window should be 17cm

    * Modify: PATIENT AND OT DONNING ALL S 1 5 10 14 AVERAGED
      - remove regression

3) similarly do the same but with three plots: TPR_all_patients_s12345 on left, FES_all_S1_5 in middle,
    final_threshold_all_patients on right

4) also with two workload plots, OTs_workload on left, carer_patient_workload_first_last_and_independent on right

5) also last one with carer_patient_satisfaction_first_last_and_independent on left and
    carer_patient_stress_first_last_and_independent on right.
